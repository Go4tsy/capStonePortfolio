# Portfolio Introduction
https://go4tsy.github.io/portfolioWebsite/index.html
I wanted to design an online portfolio that would be professional and representative of myself. Portfolio design is something that piques my interest,it gives the creator or the client a unique platform to present their work and services to a wide audience. As a user viewing my portfolio page, I want to see who this person is, i want to know their identity, their interestsm their plans and their story. A quick introduction of themselves with a picture of them. I want an app that is simple to understand and easy to navigate through. I want quick acess to sections that interets me without having any problems regarding texts over text or animation affecting my time. I want the developper to value my time as a user. I expect a nice design showing the color of the brand and some fun interactions proving the skills of the developper.
