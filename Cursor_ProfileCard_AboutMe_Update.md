# 🚀 Cursor AI Prompt: Portfolio Personal Card & About Me Rewrite

## 🎯 Context
I'm 23 years old, a Gen Z software engineer, flight attendant, and startup founder. My site is already built with React/Next.js and styled for mobile-first viewing. I want you to **rewrite and update the Profile Card and About Me section** using the following updated information, values, and tone.

---

## ✅ TASK 1: Personal Card Update

Replace my current hero/intro card with the following structure:

```
🧑‍🚀 Sean Etienne (a.k.a. Goatsy)  
Flight Attendant @ United ✈️ | Full-Stack Dev 🧠 | Startup Founder 🚀  
Helping crew connect. Building quietly. Obsessed with legacy.
```

**Subtext Tooltip or Hover:**
```
React + Firebase Dev | Layover App Founder | Gen Z Dream Builder  
Future CPO | Trading Psychology | Building Étienne Empire ⚜️
```

**Include clickable icons for:**
- GitHub  
- LinkedIn  
- TikTok  
- Threads  
- YouTube

## ✅ TASK 2: “About Me” Section Rewrite

### 🎙️ Tone
- Confident but humble  
- Strategic, slightly mysterious  
- Speaks to recruiters, tech mentors, and Gen Z creators

### 🧠 Content to Include (write as narrative):
- I’m 23 years old, Haitian-American-Canadian, currently a flight attendant for United Airlines  
- Self-taught software engineer since 2022 (React, Firebase, Next.js)  
- Founder of **CrewRoom**: a mobile-first layover app for airline crews  
- Building a **family legacy project** called the **Étienne Empire**, combining real estate, software, and education  
- Deeply interested in **trading psychology**, **automation**, and **content strategy**  
- Also known as “Goatsy” for my rizz/advice persona online — trusted by peers for dating, discipline, and mindset  
- Long-term goal: become a **Chief Product Officer (CPO)** and eventually create a **deep-dive virtual gaming experience** combining **VR + Neural Interfaces** — think *SAO meets Neuralink*, but more human-focused, immersive, and safe  
- I believe in using skills for more than profit — I plan to build **community spaces**, invest in youth, and support **charity projects** in the Caribbean and Africa  
- I stay low-key, move with intention, and let the work speak for itself

**Optional Closing Line:**  
> "The empire's already being built — brick by brick, byte by byte."

## ✅ TASK 3: Structure & Best Practices

- Modular components: use `AboutCard.tsx` or `Bio.tsx`  
- Responsive design: no breakage on mobile  
- Prepare future slots: “Press”, “Speaking”, “Charity Impact”  
- Keep code comments in major changed components

---

## 🛑 Do Not
- Overuse buzzwords  
- Be overly formal or robotic  
- Reveal future roadmap too deeply (respect Laws of Power)  
- Add animations or drastic style changes

---

## 📎 Goal
Final content should inspire recruiters, developers, and dreamers. It must reflect my **multi-dimensional skills**, **spiritual values**, **growth mindset**, and **future vision** — in a way that's **real, strategic, and Gen Z-native**.

**Proceed.**
